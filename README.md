# Nanopore 1D time series data

Exploring single-molecule classification using nanopore sensors and deep learning algorithms.

The CNN model currently achieves ~80-85% accuracy on a 12-way classification set, depending on input size, model parameters, and training time. Will update soon with LSTM and CNN-LSTM architectures, though they currently achieve less accuracy (~70%) than the pure CNN.

The 1D deep learning algorithms explored here were originally forked from https://github.com/healthDataScience/deep-learning-HAR.
